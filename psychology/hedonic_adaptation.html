      <h3>Greediness is a natural human tendency, <br />but is it bad?</h3>
      <p class="author">By Ruochen Fu</p>
      <p>
        The phenomenon called “Hedonic Adaptation” is a natural process in every
        human’s brain that causes all, and I mean all no matter what magnitude
        in happiness level (happy or sad) to eventually fade to a set level
        after some period of time. Many may argue that this is a flaw in the
        “design” of the brain, that it forces people to always chase for more,
        or for men to always be “greedy”. It is even considered a deadly sin in
        all of the Christian, Islamic, or Judaic culture, even though it’s one
        of the few properties of one’s brain that we are born with, not
        acquired.

        How long were you genuinely happy after experiencing something good,
        like a long-awaited item you finally saved enough to get?
      </p>

      <p>
        This psychological phenomenon happens all the time. Many falsely believe
        these kinds of events or objects or would have a long-term effect on our
        wellbeing, our happiness would be constantly compounding, and our
        baseline happiness levels would steadily increase. This is not the case.
        In our chase of happiness, we will most definitely find ourselves caught
        in this cycle known as the hedonic treadmill, where the process of
        hedonic adaptation happens repeatedly. This theory suggests that despite
        experiencing very positive events or acquiring desirable objects, our
        happiness levels will return to a stable baseline, until the next time
        this happens. This cycle happens on and on throughout your entire life,
        and is the reason that people always chase for more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although some might argue that hedonic adaptation turns people more, as
        previously mentioned, greedy or never satisfied, making everyone never
        satisfied with what they have. Indeed, it can lead to fall backs or
        frustrations when achievements, possessions, or experiences lose their
        initial excitement, and it’s true that people often crave more after
        every chase for things such as money, wealth, grades, success, or even
        just possessions. Psychologists like and are not limited to Ed Diener
        (2006) and Sonja Lyubomirsky (2005) argue that hedonic adaptation serves
        a functional purpose, and is crucial to our existence as humans.

        The fact that Hedonic Adaptation is a beneficial property of the human
        brain, can be concluded from a wide range of trusted sources of
        information by well-known professors and professionals in the field of
        Psychology and neuroscience. One of the sources that can help
        demonstrate this fact is the 2010 paper titled “Hedonic capital,
        adaptation and resilience” by Liam Graham, Andrew J. Oswald. The paper
        explicitly links “psychological resilience” to the “level of hedonic
        capital”. Showing that in the times with more positive emotions, your
        brain saves up “hedonic capital”, a flow of “hedonic energy” you can
        spend on feeling good now or reinvest to preserve/grow future
        well-being. However, the hedonic capital also depreciates unless you
        invest to maintain it. The authors of the paper showed that this new
        stock-and-flow-like setup is a viable model of the phenomenon of hedonic
        adaptation. This model made one benefit of the phenomenon of hedonic
        adaptation more clear, greatly lessens the effect of great “bad shock”
        or traumatic experiences for people, by making sure people can buffer
        their level of happiness as “level of hedonic capital” to be against the
        previously mentioned strikes, allowing people to bounce back from
        negative events, can be inferred from the paper. This is one piece of
        evidence that can show the benefit of the phenomenon of Hedonic
        Adaptation.

      <p>
        Another evidence or reason that shows that the psychological phenomenon
        of hedonic adaptation is beneficial toward all human beings is that it
        can renew focus and motivation. According to the 1998 September paper by
        Barbara L. Fredrickson titled “What Good Are Positive Emotions?”, after
        the human body forces people to adapt to a positive life change such as
        a new car or promotion, and a person’s happiness returns to the
        baseline, the person will be forced by the “design” to reset their goal
        and continue to be motivated to go for new opportunities. Compared to if
        the happiness from each event lasts forever, humans will lose the
        ability to set new goals, or want for more, there will be little
        motivation for progressing forward. Taking the example of athletes, when
        an athlete achieves a personal record, such as running a hundred meters
        in 11.5 seconds, they will feel great joy. But as time moves on, when
        reaching such speed becomes routine, the athlete will naturally go for
        11 seconds, even 10.5 seconds. This is due to the temporary nature of
        the enjoyment, and it is this temporary nature of the satisfaction that
        helps maintain motivation in training and pushes performance
        improvements, leading to great achievements today for mankind such as
        under 10 seconds records which were once thought to be impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a more recent paper titled Running on the Hedonic Treadmill: A
        Dynamical Model of Happiness Based on an Approach–Avoidance Framework
        released in June 2024 published by Jean-Denis Mathias, it shows that the
        hedonic treadmill also show the behaviour similar of an
        approach/avoidance framework. They show that when someone fails to
        activate behaviour, for example, remaining still, or doesn’t engage in
        approach behaviour, their pleasure/hedonic level declines greatly due to
        adaptation. This shows the other side of this property, how this system
        of hedonic treadmill actively punishes behavior of staying in the same
        comfort zone. With these two pieces of research and not only these two,
        we can see that rather than being a flaw in human psychology, the
        hedonic treadmill is a crucial motivational system that promotes
        resilience, growth, and advancement, making it a beneficial feature of
        the human mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, this ability of hedonic adaptation is very important
        throughout the entire history of mankind, and is partly responsible for
        every innovation that led to the modern day as we know it today, and
        history is fueled by the people that aren’t content with the status quo.
        When the pleasure from success fades, individuals are encouraged to set
        new goals, learn new skills, and pursue further challenges. This
        continual striving promotes personal growth, innovation, and long-term
        well-being, rather than complacency.
      </p>

      <p>
        To conclude, while this natural process of the human brain may seem to
        be the cause of great sin, greed, this perspective often overlooks its
        crucial part in human psychology, and its crucial role in what leads to
        humans as we know it today, evolutionary purposes. Rather than being a
        flaw in the system, it’s a natural tendency and an adaptive system that
        fosters personal growth, motivation, and rehabilitation or recovery
        after great traumatic experiences. By allowing happiness to fade over
        time, it encourages more goal setting and is the fuel for one to chase
        for it. It drives progress, personal achievements. It helps maintain
        emotional balance, reduces the emotional damage one might have faced,
        and is chosen by the natural selection. Understanding this fundamental
        human feature allows us to appreciate its true value and meaning. It is
        not about making humans greedy, but about helping them thrive.
